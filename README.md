 🌍 Travel Booking App – Complete UI/UX Case Study

Welcome to the design breakdown of my Travel Booking Mobile Application, a fully-crafted end-to-end UI/UX project focused on helping users discover, compare, and book holiday packages with ease.
This project brings together clean aesthetics, functional flows, and an intuitive structure to deliver a smooth travel-planning experience.

✨ Project Overview

This mobile app is designed to simplify the travel-booking journey. The goal was to build an interface where users can:

Explore popular destinations

Compare multiple packages

View itinerary & pricing details

Book trips seamlessly

Manage personal information & preferences

The app maintains a consistent visual identity with gold & white accents, as seen in the uploaded screens (page 1)

, giving it a premium travel-brand feel.

🎨 Design Approach
1. Minimal & Premium Visual Language

The splash screen and header components use a clean gold color palette for a luxury travel vibe (page 1)

.

Rounded cards, smooth shadows, and crisp typography enhance visual clarity.

Imagery is used extensively to create excitement and aspiration during destination browsing.

2. Intuitive Navigation

A simple tab-based or menu-based system allows users to switch quickly between Home, Explore, Bookings, Profile, etc.

The flow for login > home > package > checkout follows an industry-standard pattern for familiarity.
